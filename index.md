# Control Barrier Functions in Aerospace: From Foundations to Real-World Applications
## Pre-Conference Tutorial Workshop at CEAS EuroGNC 2026

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a powerful framework for enforcing safety and state constraints in control systems, offering rigorous guarantees on constraint satisfaction and forward invariance. While CBF-based methods are now well established in the control theory community, their systematic adoption in aerospace applications remains limited, despite clear relevance to problems such as flight envelope protection, geofencing, collision avoidance, and autonomy.

This tutorial workshop aims to bridge this gap by providing an accessible yet rigorous introduction to Control Barrier Functions and their application to safety-critical aerospace systems. The program combines foundational theory with application-driven perspectives, highlighting practical design methodologies, implementation challenges, and pathways toward real-world deployment.

The workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners from control theory and aerospace engineering, fostering cross-disciplinary exchange and discussion on open challenges, certification aspects, and future directions for CBF-based guidance, navigation, and control across both aeronautical and space systems.
